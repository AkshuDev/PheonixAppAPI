PHardwareITK
------------

**Description:**

The `PHardwareITK` library provides a comprehensive toolkit for interacting with hardware components and functionalities. It offers functionalities for various hardware-related tasks, including:

* Error handling and system management
* File system operations
* Graphical User Interface (GUI) development
* Hardware control and interaction (details to be filled based on available functionalities)
* Module management and control
* Low-level programming aspects (details to be filled based on available functionalities)

# Files

**Description**: The files directly available in the phardwareitk module.

## LIB
**Internal Paths:**

The `phardwareitk.LIB` module establishes various file paths within the library structure. These paths are used to access sub-modules and functionalities.

**Classes:**

**1. Paths:**

This class provides pre-defined paths to various directories and files within the `PHardwareITK` library. It avoids the need for manually constructing paths throughout the codebase.

**Example:**

    .. code-block:: python

      import phardwareitk.LIB as phLIB
   
      # Access the path to the ErrorSystem directory
      error_system_path = phLIB.Paths.ErrorSystem
   
      print(error_system_path)  # Output: /path/to/phardwareitk/ErrorSystem
