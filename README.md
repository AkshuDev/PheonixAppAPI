# Available Toolkits ->
1. CLI Toolkit:

The CLI Toolkit provides over 50 distinct functions for creating and managing command-line interfaces (CLI). It enables developers to rapidly build custom CLI applications, similar to nano or other text-based utilities, with minimal lines of code.

Key features:

50+ pre-built functions to handle inputs, outputs, and commands. \
Full control over terminal interactions and interface flow. \
Support for custom command parsing and input handling. \
Text Output/Input with font and colors.

2. GUI Toolkit

The GUI Toolkit is a cross-platform toolkit that allows developers to create complex graphical user interfaces from scratch. It supports multiple UI frameworks including OpenGL, SDL2. The toolkit is fully customizable and provides advanced functionality for creating modern applications.

It is under development and renderGUI.pyx has to be compiled by GCC/Clang and Cython. Instead for the time, use gui_sdl.py (phardwareitk.GUI.gui). The functions inside gui_sdl and renderGUI are supposed to make the process easy, but it is still under development. Hence, you can still use SDL and OpenGL functions to do whatever you want unlike PyQT5 and Tkinter. This toolkit provides all the functions in SDL2 and OpenGL.

Key features:

Full cross-platform support (Linux, Windows, macOS). \
Highly customizable and extensible components. \
Multiple backend support (OpenGL, SDL2).

The ErrorSystem provides a complete error handling framework with over 50 built-in error classes. It also allows users to create custom error classes for more specialized exceptions.

Key features:

A robust set of error classes for different scenarios. \
Custom error class creation for specialized needs. \
Detailed error messages and stack trace support. 

5. System
   
The System folder includes a range of system utilities such as SysUsage, which allows you to monitor and interact with your computer’s hardware and devices.

Key features:

50+ functions to interact with hardware, monitor system performance, and manage processes. \
Real-time usage statistics and logging.

6. Extensions
   
The Extensions folder provides enhanced versions of Python's built-in functions, adding more capabilities. For example, the printH function in the HyperOut.py file allows for advanced text printing with background and foreground colors, fonts, and other enhancements. It also includes custom functions that make hard parts of programming easy like -> progressH that can create a progress bar in the terminal. It is highly flexible.

NOTE: Mostly all terminal tasks even inside the phardwareitk are done using the cliToolKit.py (phardwareitk.CLI.cliToolKit).

NOTE: phardwareitk.Extensions.HyperIn.inputH is a fully custom input function that doesn't use Python's input. Hence, some important factors are to NOTE -

a. It is still Under Enhancements and if any bug occurs please provide a detailed explanation in [https://github/AkshuDev/PHardwareITK/Issues].
b. It requires a time sleep to prevent CPU Hogging, the cpuHogging parameter in the function is defined to be 0.005 seconds or 5 milliseconds, you cannot go under 3 milliseconds or 0.003 seconds, as it is very dangerous for the CPU to do so.

Key features:

Extended versions of basic Python functions. \
Support for custom styling (colors, fonts) in terminal output. \
Enhanced file writing operations. 

7. FileSystem
   
The FileSystem toolkit provides utilities for performing file operations, including working with JSON, assembly, and binary formats. The module includes over 50 functions for tasks ranging from simple file manipulation to complex data transformations.

Key features:

Support for JSON, binary, and assembly file formats. \
High-level functions for file manipulation and data storage.

8. HGame
   
HGame is an alternative to Pygame, providing a more flexible framework for game development. It supports multiple rendering backends, including PHardwareITK.GUI, Tkinter, OpenGL, and SDL2, making it highly cross-platform.

NOTE: Not yet ready for use, just use GUI toolkit for the time.

Key features:

Multiple rendering backends. \
Cross-platform game development support. \
Easy-to-use game object management and event handling.

9. Dependencies.py
    
The Dependencies.py file contains a list of all required libraries and modules for PHardwareITK. This file ensures that any missing dependencies are noted and can be easily installed. NOTE: All requirements are default modules. This files Exisits to install them incase, they are deleted.

11. LIB.py
    
The LIB.py file contains a class called Paths, which provides access to file paths across the entire module. This class is useful for dynamically managing file locations without hardcoding paths.

# Dependencies

PHardwareITK is designed to run with mostly the Python standard library, ensuring compatibility across all systems with minimal need for external dependencies. However, in the case that any of the pre-installed modules are deleted or missing, the Dependencies.py file will help ensure that all necessary libraries are present.

Required Dependencies ->

1. PySDL2 (pip install pysdl2)
2. PySDL2-DLL (pip install pysdl2-dll)
3. PyOpenGL (pip install PyOpenGL)

NOTE: All these are for the gui toolkit.
